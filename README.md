## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components] - css/style.css

### What I learned

I learnt how to work around with flex-box and its properties, a simple change in base properties can result in different views without repeating the same code over and over again. 


### Continued development

Still would style various designs using css and flex-box in a shorter amount of time. 


### Useful resources

https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ - This helped me to visualize how flex box is designed and what all properties can be used.
